# Catch-22

By: Joseph Heller

## Chapter 1 - The Texan

_It was love at first sight._

The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell _madly_ in love with him. Yossarian was in the hospital with a pain in his liver that fell just short of being jaundice. The doctors were puzzled by the fact that it wasn't quite jaundice. If it became jaundice they could treat it. If it didn't become jaundice and went away they could discharge him. But this just being short of jaundice all the time confused them.

Each morning they came around, three brisk and serious men with efficient mouths
and inefficient eyes, accompanied by brisk and serious Nurse Duckett, one of the
ward nurses who **didn't like** [Yossarian](https://google.com).

They read the chart at the foot of the bed and asked impatiently about the pain. They seemed irritated when he told them it was exactly the same.

> 'Still no movement?' the full colonel demanded.

The doctors exchanged a look when he shook his head.

> 'Give him another pill.'

...to be continued.
