It will appear in the same directory as the Markdown you are converting, with the same name and a different extension.\n\n![markdown-pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/travs/markdown-pdf/master/assets/testpdf.png)\n\nYou can set parameters in the package's settings, such as page size, orientation, and output format (pdf, png or jpeg).\n\n### How it works\n\nThe HTML provided by running the markdown through [marked](https://www.npmjs.org/package/marked) is prepended with the css from the [markdown-preview atom package](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview). The syntax-highlights styling is pulled from the user's currently-active theme and added in the same way.\n\nThis HTML+CSS is then fed to [html-pdf](https://www.npmjs.org/package/html-pdf), which outputs the final image (pdf, png or jpeg) doc.\n\nThe package has dependencies on [tree-view](https://github.com/atom/tree-view) and [markdown-preview](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview), but since these are included in the default atom installation, you probably won't have to worry about that.\n\n#### Heart it? Hate it?\nFeel free to run `apm star 'markdown-pdf'` or give some feedback :smile:\n\n##### Special thanks to these folks\n\n- [@schmurphy](https://github.com/NKMR6194): [#11](https://github.com/travs/markdown-pdf/pull/11)\n- [@NKMR6194](https://github.com/NKMR6194): [#51](https://github.com/travs/markdown-pdf/pull/51), [#83](https://github.com/travs/markdown-pdf/pull/83)\n- [@Nicnl](https://github.com/Nicnl): [#28](https://github.com/travs/markdown-pdf/pull/28)\n- [@brianchung808](https://github.com/brianchung808): [#34](https://github.com/travs/markdown-pdf/pull/34)\n- [@hdmi](https://github.com/hdmi): [#53](https://github.com/travs/markdown-pdf/pull/53)\n- [@CumpsD](https://github.com/CumpsD): [#59](https://github.com/travs/markdown-pdf/pull/59)\n- [@pydolan](https://github.com/pydolan): [#72](https://github.com/travs/markdown-pdf/pull/72), [#74](https://github.com/travs/markdown-pdf/pull/74)\n- [@Galadirith](https://github.com/Galadirith): [#88](https://github.com/travs/markdown-pdf/pull/88)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/travs/markdown-pdf/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/travs/markdown-pdf#readme","_id":"markdown-pdf@1.5.0","_shasum":"f4f29408438df7240e6d8c5614aa1393dfb4121c","_resolved":"file:../d-1161020-11794-15i6lp8/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1161020-11794-15i6lp8/package.tgz"}
